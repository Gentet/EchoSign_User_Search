## Chrome Extension - EchoSign User Search
================

This tool enables you to search for a User on the EchoSign website.

This happens once being prompted to enter a users name or email address, you can also add "--" to the end of the text that you are searching for. This will search for a user without having the _"Show only active users"_ checkbox checked, this will mean that you will be able to search for all users, even if they have been deactivated or if they have not yet accepted the EchoSign terms of use/they are unverified.
